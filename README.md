# Aqua Adventure 3
A game created for a high school project. Made in Pygame. It's poorly written but I love it; run main.py to play.

Art assets are not my own. I wish I could credit the creators but this was made over 2 years ago and I failed to record my sources. Sounds were obtained from freesound.org. 


# The Series
Aqua Adventure 1 - basically a low effort asset flip made for a class in elementary school. It's not good and won't see the light of day.

Aqua Adventure 2 - a text-based tale of humanity's destruction and your effort to save it. Basically the start of my game dev journey.

Aqua Adventure: Total Betrayal - a game set in the AA universe; collaborative project in grade 12? CS. Probably won't release this one.

Aqua Adventure 3 - this game! the last Aqua Adventure game, made in Pygame. It's pretty barebones and rushed but has some (IMO) really cool ideas.


# The Future
I may or may not be slowly remaking a few of these games, but with actual development standards and time and effort. Only time will tell :)
