# Aqua Adventure 3
Sequel to Aqua Adventure 2 and Aqua Adventure: Total Betrayal. Only one of those is publicly available. 

A game created for a high school project. Made in Pygame. It's poorly written but I love it; run main.py to play.

Art assets are not my own. I wish I could credit the creators but this was made over 2 years ago and I failed to record my sources. Sounds were obtained from freesound.org.
